### Quickstart with my config:
```
cd ~/.config/ && git clone https://github.com/styrman-g/nvim
```
- I have nothing in my init.lua file. I only recuire the other files.
- All my vim keybindings are in keymaps.lua
- All my vim options are in options.lua
- All my keybindings for plugins are in plugins/keymaps.lua
- All my options for plugins are in plugins/options.lua
- I use lazy for installing pluggins
